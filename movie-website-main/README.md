# Movie Website Project

This is a Movie library web application with the below features -

1. User authentication
2. After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they would see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies. 
3. They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. ( Similar to youtube playlists ).
4. On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.
5. These lists can be either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) or private ( only the person who created can see this list )
6. I have used the OMDB API for the movie search option.
